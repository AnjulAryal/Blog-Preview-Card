## Overview
This project is based on the blog-preview-card challenge from Frontend Mentor. The challenge allowed me to practice structuring a simple yet effective component, reinforcing my HTML and CSS skills.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

### Continued development
I plan to focus more on improving the responsiveness of the layout for various devices.


### Useful resources
